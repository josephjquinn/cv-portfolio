        description: (
            <p>In this project, I use my advantage skill to design my own character. Itâ€™s inspired by the game Hollow Knight. Then I create a sprite sheet with run, attack, jump, and dash actions. Finally, make animation by using Javascript.
                <br/><br/>
                Thanks to the powerful HTML Canvas Graphic Method that makes it is easy for me to render each frame correctly. With the retention of the image in the human eye, if I render each frame of an action in a short time, I can create the feeling that the character is moving. Similar to the old-generation 2D games.
                <br/><br/>
                In addition to managing a large number of character properties, I have to use "Object" and its methods. This project helped me understand a lot more about Object Oriented.
                <br/><br/>
                Note: All of these things, I learned from the Franks Laboratory.

                Talking about the technical aspects, this is a simple website consisting of just a navbar with an animation that spans out when the user hovers over it. Along with eye-catching page transition effects.
                <br/><br/>
                To do that, I had to combine React Router Dom and Framer motion.

            <p>This project is a front-end developer test of the MOCK interview. Fetching Pokemon API with React as a framework. Once again, I took advantage of my graphic design to create a simple yet interesting UI.

                This project gives me the opportunity to work with fetching data, array method, filtering, and finding the corresponding pokemon when the user types in the search bar.
